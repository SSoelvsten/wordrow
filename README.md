## Usage

The _main_ branch is split in two:

- **dict**:
  The list of words for all supported languages - including a Rust program to
  obtain these from _.dic_ and _.aff_ files and another to convert them into the
  game instances.

- **src**
  The source files for the game logic.

These are precompiled into the final game served on the _gh-pages_ branch.
